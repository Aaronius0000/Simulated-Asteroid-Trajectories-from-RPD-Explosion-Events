# Simulated-Asteroid-Trajectories-from-RPD-Explosion-Events
This N-body simulation, conducted using REBOUND (Rein &amp; Liu, 2012), models asteroid trajectories from three explosion events of Earth Mark One (EM1) at 2.8 AU (t=0, pink), 3.0 AU (t=20, yellow), and 1.0 AU (t=40, green), each dispersing 50 asteroids with velocities up to 1.2 times escape velocity over 100 years. The Sun (yellow dot) is at ...
